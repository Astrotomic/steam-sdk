And that also means we're celebrating the game's [b]9th anniversary[\/b] this month. 9 years since the release of 1.0 \\\"Gamma\\\", let that sink in! Even more special is the fact that a lot of new players are still joining the ranks. Welcome to you all! We hope you enjoy the vast amount of content available to you, official and from the community alike. You may not know this, but we used to publish these blogs every single week during prime-time development. Things have slowed down, as we've discussed in our preview reports, but the platform is still supported by a small crew. There have continued to be platform updates and many experimental branch releases. And the Creator DLC program is still seeing plenty of activity too. In the broader Armaverse, much has happened of course. The Enfusion era of Arma was started with the early access release of Arma Reforger. Many of Bohemia's developers are working on those projects now, working very hard to stabilize and expand that young platform. In this report we will try to provide a status update on how Arma 3's development was influenced, if at all. Read on and see you in-game!\\n\\n[url=https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00241]Full SITREP[\/url]\",\"feedlabel\":\"Community Announcements\",\"date\":1663597038,\"feedname\":\"steam_community_announcements\",\"feed_type\":1,\"appid\":107410},{\"gid\":\"6258337460543765540\",\"title\":\"Community Radar #31\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/steamstore-a.akamaihd.net\/news\/externalpost\/steam_community_announcements\/6258337460543765540\",\"is_external_url\":true,\"author\":\"LeClair\",\"contents\":\"[url=https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/community-radar-31][img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/2799889\/b34639305dc6ab884f86c6b5ec60596ab8488386.png[\/img][\/url]\\n\\nTo keep the celebration of the 9th anniversary of Arma 3 going, we're bringing you another set of awesome community content in this month's Community Radar!\\n\\nThank you for your years of creativity and development!\\n\\n[h3][url=https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/community-radar-31]Full COMRAD[\/url][\/h3]\",\"feedlabel\":\"Community Announcements\",\"date\":1663250407,\"feedname\":\"steam_community_announcements\",\"feed_type\":1,\"appid\":107410},{\"gid\":\"4606641560263068376\",\"title\":\"SECREP #00036\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/steamstore-a.akamaihd.net\/news\/externalpost\/steam_community_announcements\/4606641560263068376\",\"is_external_url\":true,\"author\":\"YorisYanBohemia\",\"contents\":\"[b]FROM[\/b]: [url=http:\/\/www.battleye.com\/support\/faq\/]BattlEye[\/url]\\n[b]TO[\/b]: Arma 3 Users\\n[b]UNIT[\/b]: Main Branch\\n[b]ACTIVITY[\/b]: Anti-Cheat Update\\n[b]SIZE[\/b]: ~15 MB\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/2799889\/201ef36c1385c13830810ef0d47a1d70c6f3a5f2.png[\/img]\",\"feedlabel\":\"Community Announcements\",\"date\":1662990316,\"feedname\":\"steam_community_announcements\",\"feed_type\":1,\"appid\":107410,\"tags\":[\"patchnotes\"]},{\"gid\":\"4606641560251504418\",\"title\":\"Bohemia Interactive Publisher Sale\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/steamstore-a.akamaihd.net\/news\/externalpost\/steam_community_announcements\/4606641560251504418\",\"is_external_url\":true,\"author\":\"JanBI\",\"contents\":\"Summer is over, but that doesn\u2019t mean your fun has to be.
