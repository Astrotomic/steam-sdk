Plazas and Promenades is almost here, and I\u2019m so excited that you will soon be able to enjoy it. As with every major expansion, we have a little something for all players who own the base game, and today\u2019s Dev Diary is all about the free content!\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with a convenient new feature, [b]Quit After Saving[\/b], which can be enabled when saving your city. As you may have guessed from the name, it will quit the game once it finishes saving, allowing you to skip the process of saving, waiting for it to finish just to select exit and get a warning about losing progress if you haven\u2019t saved. Very handy when you\u2019re done playing and just need to save and quit the game.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/cc5a798d813c4bf027338d5fd9f45fe1671abc81.png[\/img]\\n[i]Check the box before saving to quit automatically[\/i]\\n\\n[h2]New roads[\/h2]\\nAs roads are a central part of any city, we are expanding the options even further with 18 new roads. We had a look through the road types you have wished for over the years and added as many of them as we could in this patch. This includes a series of roads with bus-priority lanes, which can be used by other vehicles if they need to turn, and for the first time ever bus-only lanes and roads!\\n\\nIn the [b]Small Roads[\/b] category, you can soon find the new small road with wide sidewalks and small one-way road with wide sidewalks, as well as small roads with a concrete median, grass median, and tree median. For the busier parts of the city, you can grab the small 4-lane road or the 4-lane road with bus lanes, or expand your one-way road system with the 3-lane one-way and 4-lane one-way roads. \\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/d99edfef5ad1442b89b225a74de6acdb35d303af.png[\/img]\\n[i]Stylish and practical selection of new roads[\/i]\\n\\nNew in the [b]Large Roads[\/b] category are the new large roads with medians, featuring 6 lanes in two directions separated by either a concrete median, grass median, or tree-lined median - the latter of which comes in both a regular version and a bus-priority lane version.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/2e6d645170536b1f98f402c4e51cb48b7ad10a70.png[\/img]\\n[i]Expand your busy roads using these new options[\/i]\\n\\nLastly, we have a handful of new Highways for you using the all-new bus-only lanes. Create a high-speed bus network with the two-way bus-only expressway which comes both with or without sound barriers, or integrate bus-only lanes into your existing highways with the highway with bus-only lanes, both with or without sound barriers. And to connect them all you can use the bus-only expressway ramp.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/f99350310611fbc488302310b114cbbdfc6d9697.png[\/img]\\n[i]Build a bus rapid transit system using the new highways[\/i]\\n\\nWe look forward to seeing how your cities will benefit from these new options and which ones will be your favorites.

Today\u2019s dev diary is all about the new district specializations and new maps, so let\u2019s check them out.\\n\\nFirst up we have the three new [b]Wall-to-wall[\/b] specializations that can be used for residential, commercial, and office zones. They unlock at Milestone 6 - Big Town, along with high-density zoning. Each specialization features 48 new modern low-rise buildings to create a unique area in your city. As a new feature to the game, these buildings have murals, which are randomly selected each time a building spawns to create additional variation and color in the neighborhoods.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/2ae72141c1cbc01793f0c5bdd3b9f80cc1a89dce.png[\/img]\\n[i]A sprawling wall-to-wall neighborhood[\/i]\\n\\nThe new wall-to-wall specializations don\u2019t just look cool, but as a specialization, they also work slightly differently from regular zone types. To reflect their modern construction, these buildings have a lower risk of catching fire, but as they\u2019re built close together, fires spread more easily between them. So make sure to keep a few fire stations nearby just in case they do catch fire.\\n\\nLike previous specializations, they can be found in the Districts and Areas menu under each zone tab and are applied to a district by selecting the specialization and clicking on a district. For pedestrian areas, however, there is no need to create a district, as specializations can be applied directly to the area. If a district and a pedestrian area overlap and have different specializations applied for a specific zone, like commercial, the pedestrian area specialization will be the one used.\\n\\n[h2]New maps[\/h2]\\nNow we can\u2019t have an expansion without new maps for you to build on! For Plazas and Promenades, we have 5 maps for you to choose from, featuring different landscapes and themes.\\n\\nFirst is the temperate map of [b]Cape Apple[\/b]. You start centered on a long peninsula with easy access to the surrounding landmasses, creating an excellent environment for a thriving metropolis. Take advantage of the ship connections to bring in tourists or set up a bustling industry along the coast as you build your new city.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/85bd59ccf74e503eee6a05dfc1862b67a70436e0.png[\/img]\\n[i]Cape Apple offers wide open spaces ready to be developed[\/i]\\n\\nNext, we journey to the tropics with [b]Coastal Gem[\/b]. It features long wide beaches and lots of open space to build a city on. You can expand inland to reach some of the area's many ore deposits or claim the coastline and benefit from the added land value of waterfront property.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/3ec247c7e1b0e3b504baca15e0b63e1f0883915d.png[\/img]\\n[i]Coastal Gem lives up to its name with its beautiful beaches[\/i]\\n\\n[b]Gondola Islands [\/b]is the first of our two new European maps. It is made up of a cluster of islands of varying sizes only connected to the mainland by a bridge. Whether you create island communities focused on walkability using pedestrian areas or connect the many islands using the new roads, Gondola Islands will shape any city built here.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/b55b1bf5171e116aa37ed2f1cd46b290a16c3efb.png[\/img]\\n[i]The island cluster of Gondola Islands have much to offer[\/i]\\n\\nThe boreal map of [b]Oracle Lake[\/b] offers a large valley filled with forests and lakes for you to build your city on. Base the city\u2019s industry on the large forests, extract the abundant ore in the area, or focus on creating a vibrant tourist destination. The choice is yours.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/ad4de4078d5ab8e6a6f643b32c472bc0b27cf4a8.png[\/img]\\n[i]Oracle Lake features many scenic views[\/i]\\n\\nLast but not least is our second European map, [b]Splitz Tributary[\/b]. Build your city at the foot of the mountains or along the banks of the rivers meeting here. With lots of buildable land, your city can take many forms.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/4b6b5f554905bb226dcf729ceb8fb891ae0e0054.png[\/img]\\n[i]Splitz Tributary is an ideal location for a new city[\/i]\\n\\nThis concludes our Dev Diaries for the new content coming in Plazas and Promenades. On Tuesday, we\u2019ll have a look at the free update that adds something new for everyone, as well as the patch notes so you\u2019re completely up to date before release.

We\u2019ve also included 23 new props and 20 new decals. These can be found in the Pedestrian Area Plazas tab. They provide a colorful modern look to your city and allow you to put a personal touch on your pedestrian areas. \\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/0c785e72728d59fbefe4a29436e157fafcba64a6.png[\/img]\\n[i]The new props can be used to decorate corners of your city[\/i]\\n\\n[h2]New Service Buildings[\/h2]\\nBesides decorative buildings, we have a selection of new service buildings in the form of 6 new service buildings and 5 new public transportation buildings. All of these have a modern style and high capacity, offering both practical and stylish new options.\\n\\nThe [b]High-Capacity Elementary School[\/b] is quite a bit larger than the other schools we have, and it\u2019s able to accommodate up to 800 students, making it ideal for neighborhoods with many families. In a similar fashion, the [b]High-Capacity High School[\/b] can educate more than twice as many students as the existing ones, with a capacity of 2400. And last, in the education menu, you will find the [b]High-Capacity University[\/b], which can accept up to 10,000 students at a time.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/0299cb6f5d9ce3c5a723d0441818b575e5533cd8.png[\/img]\\n[i]Educate even more citizens using the new high-capacity options[\/i]\\n\\nMoving on to health and safety, we have the [b]High-Capacity Hospital[\/b], able to handle a substantial number of patients, and the [b]High-Capacity Police Headquarters[\/b] and [b]High-Capacity Fire Station[\/b], both of which have a significant number of vehicles available to allow them to respond to more emergencies at once.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/b0f90c6b06d171d5b1160b987c53fed7f8e15e46.png[\/img]\\n[i]New high-capacity services to keep your citizens healthy and safe[\/i]\\n\\nThere are also new buildings in the Public Transportation menu.

Today we explore the details of how to manage pedestrian areas, what progression looks like for them, and what an area focus is. So get comfortable and let\u2019s get started.\\n\\nThe key to a successful pedestrian area is managing the service points and keeping citizens happy and entertained. As mentioned in the previous Dev Diary, service points have a maximum capacity. This is the number of trucks that can visit them per week. It can be seen both on the tooltip of each building as well as when selecting it.\\n\\nIf a service point nears its capacity for either cargo or garbage, it will notify you of high traffic but will continue to function. If it reaches its capacity for one or both types of trucks, it will be unable to service all buildings. This will lead to garbage piling up or goods not being delivered. Make sure your pedestrian area has enough service points and that these are spread out to avoid traffic congestion.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/db454eef053ccd3930bea5388cbdf50aa329c718.png[\/img]\\n[i]Add more service points when you reach maximum capacity[\/i]\\n\\n[h2]Pedestrian Area Panel[\/h2]\\nTo see how well your area is doing, select the name of the pedestrian area or use the button on any service point to open the [b]Pedestrian Area Info Panel[\/b]. The panel displays the average happiness of all buildings in an area, and the entertainment provided by parks and plazas divided by the size of the area. These are combined into a land value bonus, which is applied to the entire area, just like the entertainment is, making pedestrian areas more desirable for citizens and businesses.\\n\\nThe Area Panel also shows a breakdown of the different zone types in an area, as well as the area focus, which is determined by the most prevalent zone type in an area. The focus can be either residential, commercial, workplaces (industry and offices combined), or mixed. Only the zones on pedestrian streets in an area count towards the area focus.\\n\\nLast but not least, the info tab contains a handy overview of the area\u2019s service points and their capacity for both cargo and garbage, as well as information about the area\u2019s size and maintenance cost.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/9baed2478927d8e9424246a9d98a01446aa971c3.png[\/img]\\n[i]The Pedestrian Area Info Panel provides an overview of your pedestrian area[\/i]\\n\\n[h2]Progression & Focus[\/h2]\\nPedestrian areas do not have levels like other area types, but instead have different categories of buildings that get unlocked simultaneously. Some of these are universal and can be unlocked by any pedestrian area, while others are tied to a specific zone type. The [b]Unlocking[\/b] tab on the Pedestrian Area Panel shows you what is required to unlock each building and how close you are to unlocking them.\\n\\nAdditional [b]Service Points[\/b] can be unlocked by any area as it grows and as service points are visited by more trucks. New service points in turn help you better handle the demands of the area as it grows. Like service points, [b]Plazas[\/b] can be unlocked by any area. As their unlocking depends on the land value bonus the area provides, make sure to have plenty of services, education, as well as parks and plazas in place.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/6b1579565cf6b3986df31dbf3ba1fe11c8bae694.png[\/img]\\n[i]Unlock more service points, plazas, and unique buildings as your pedestrian area grows[\/i]\\n\\nNext up we have the 6 new unique buildings, which come in two categories and can be found in the Unique Buildings menu. [b]Pedestrian Area Landmarks[\/b] tie into the area focus for an area and require either a number of residents, goods sold, or workplaces in an area to unlock.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the [b]Tourism Buildings[\/b] are unlocked by reaching certain levels of weekly tourists visiting a pedestrian area. While these are not tied to a zone focus, you will need to provide attractions for tourists to visit in the form of parks and plazas, unique buildings, or commercial buildings.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/0a7049b08a2f519845c3435bc585560df1003b91.png[\/img]\\n[i]Increase the attractiveness of your city using the new plazas and unique buildings[\/i]\\n\\n[h2]Area Policies[\/h2]\\nThe one tab on the Pedestrian Area Panel we haven\u2019t talked about yet is the Policies tab. On this tab, you can apply four different policies to your area to customize how it works. The policies are free to use, but each has downsides to consider.\\n\\n[b]Slow Driving[\/b] affects all roads in the area, forcing a speed limit of 20 everywhere and, as a result, decreasing noise pollution. [b]Sugar Ban[\/b] deals with the health of your citizens, increasing the lifespan of citizens, but with an increased crime rate as citizens start smuggling illegal candy bars into the area.\\n\\nYou can also allow [b]Street Music[\/b], which boosts the happiness of commercial buildings in an area but also increases the noise pollution slightly. And lastly, [b]Deliver Everything[\/b] routes all cargo and garbage through service points for all buildings in a pedestrian area. So in addition to handling the cargo and garbage needs for buildings on pedestrian streets, the service points need to handle cargo and garbage for buildings on regular roads too. I hope your service points are ready for the extra traffic!\\n\\nThat concludes this Dev Diary. I hope you now have a good idea of how pedestrian areas work and if not, don\u2019t hesitate to ask! In the next Dev Diary coming [b]Friday at 4PM CEST \/ 7AM PDT[\/b], we\u2019ll cover the new plazas & service buildings, which can be used on their own or as a part of pedestrian areas. For now, I will leave you in the hands of Overcharged Egg with this video tutorial:\\n\\n[previewyoutube=g2FTXIWm9l4;full][\/previewyoutube]\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/76a2087050957c2ba0135c6f602302af2b6f6698.png[\/img]\\n\",\"feedlabel\":\"Community Announcements\",\"date\":1661781631,\"feedname\":\"steam_community_announcements\",\"feed_type\":1,\"appid\":255710},{\"gid\":\"4514316500006444930\",\"title\":\"Plazas & Promenades Dev Diary #1\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/steamstore-a.akamaihd.net\/news\/externalpost\/steam_community_announcements\/4514316500006444930\",\"is_external_url\":true,\"author\":\"CO_Avanya\",\"contents\":\"Greetings mayors, and welcome to another set of Dev Diaries! Are you excited about Cities: Skylines Plazas and Promenades? Over the course of the next two weeks, I will walk you through all the new content from pedestrian areas and streets to new specializations and service buildings - and plazas of course! And without further ado, let\u2019s have a look at the announcement video:\\n\\n[previewyoutube=d0Q8RN9ut4s;full][\/previewyoutube]\\n\\nAt the center of [b]Cities: Skylines Plazas and Promenades[\/b] we have pedestrian areas and streets, which give you the tools to create neighborhoods focused on walkability. These will work to reduce traffic as well as noise pollution. To ensure you are able to create areas suited for your specific city, the pedestrian areas work with all existing zoned buildings! \\n\\n[h2]Creating Pedestrian Areas[\/h2]\\nPedestrian areas take advantage of the Area Tool, which you may be familiar with already. It can be found in the Districts and Areas menu and becomes available when you reach Milestone 3 - Tiny Town. Paint over empty land if you want to create a new pedestrian neighborhood, or over an existing part of your city if you wish to turn it into a pedestrian area. Like other areas and districts, it can be adjusted later as needed.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/ab8c718b2a92a0d131d10be6e235c92fb718e553.png[\/img]\\n[i]Paint a pedestrian area to unlock service points[\/i]\\n\\nOnce you are satisfied with the area, it\u2019s time to place a [b]Service Point[\/b], which can be found in the Pedestrian Areas menu under Parks & Plazas. Service points are essential to pedestrian areas as most vehicles, including garbage and delivery trucks, are not allowed on pedestrian streets. Instead, garbage is automatically collected from buildings on pedestrian streets to be picked up at the service point. Similarly, resources, goods, and mail are all routed through the service point, so make sure it\u2019s placed on a road that can handle increased truck traffic!\\n\\nService points come in two different sizes and three different types: The general [b]Service Points[\/b], which cover all the listed needs, [b]Garbage Service Points[\/b], which focus on waste management, and [b]Cargo Service Points[\/b], which handle resources, goods, and mail.\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/2cd0dcd46379206cdba724765b69df93b060ffbf.png[\/img]\\n[i]Service points are vital for your pedestrian areas[\/i]\\n\\nThe different service points are important as they each have a capacity and if the area exceeds this, some buildings on pedestrian streets will not have their needs taken care of. Large pedestrian areas will need more service points to provide for the buildings on pedestrian streets, and depending on the mix of buildings in an area, you may need a higher capacity for garbage collection or cargo delivery.\\n\\n[h2]Pedestrian Streets[\/h2]\\nWith the pedestrian area created and a service point placed, it\u2019s time to place pedestrian streets! These paved roads can only be used by walking or biking citizens and, when necessary, emergency vehicles like ambulances, hearses, police cars, and fire trucks. As citizens are the main users of the pedestrian streets, vehicles have to obey slow speed limits unless responding to an emergency.\\n\\nWe have included a lot of variation in the pedestrian streets so that you can customize the look and feel of your areas. There are 3 styles: Sandstone, Bluestone, and Cobblestone, which come in two different widths. Each street also comes with 5 different variations with things like added grass, trees, and bus-only lanes. That\u2019s a total of [b]30 different pedestrian streets[\/b] for you to choose from!\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/4de31c45e5b90ba0a6ea844ea971e94a50ef23f2.png[\/img]\\n[i]Bluestone on the left, Sandstone in the middle, and Cobblestone on the right[\/i]\\n\\nAs you\u2019re building your pedestrian streets, you may go outside the pedestrian area you defined earlier. If that happens, the streets will automatically extend the area to follow them. This option can be enabled or disabled when placing the streets. Pedestrian streets can also be placed outside pedestrian areas, but keep in mind that any buildings placed on these streets will need a pedestrian area and a service point to function.\\n\\nLastly, pedestrian streets come with a cool new little feature: Bollards automatically appear at the entrance to pedestrian streets to discourage vehicles from entering. When a vehicle needs to enter or exit the pedestrian street, they will stop and wait for the bollards to retract into the street before driving past. Isn\u2019t that cool?\\n\\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}\/6625556\/ec94402aaa0075195e759f9cc0d77ed0e6ecaea0.png[\/img]\\n[i]Bollards retracting for a waiting police car[\/i]\\n\\nThat\u2019s all we have for you this time! In the next Dev Diary, we\u2019ll cover the management and progression of pedestrian areas, so stay tuned for more information on [b]Monday at 4PM CEST \/ 7AM PDT[\/b]!
