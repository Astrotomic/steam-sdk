We\u2019re incredibly honored to see the excitement you all showed us for our evening look.\\n\\nHowever, shortly after the festivities died down we noticed a problem; A lot of you reported that you were unable to find the Haunted outfit ingame after claiming the Drop. When we started the investigation, we quickly found an issue with the way this particular outfit was named on the Twitch campaign side, so it didn\u2019t award correctly for most of you despite filling the conditions. We\u2019re not able to fix this without restarting the Twitch campaign. Instead of this, we have decided to award the outfit to all players with a Starbreeze account. All you need to do to receive the outfit is to launch the game, with your account connected, before the end of the Twitch Drop campaign.\\n\\nWe apologize for the inconvenience caused by this.

It also offers quite a fast rate of fire. Then we have the VD-12 shotgun, available either as a powerful single weapon or still powerful albeit slightly smaller version of itself in akimbo.

This time we decided to deliver on a popular request after we previously introduced Viper grenades; Tombstone slugs. This new ammo type for shotguns will allow you to really make your opponents get down with the sickness, with the ability of poison. This will cause them as much nausea as the police chief will face when he receives the medical bills after each heist.\\n\\nThere are also two new weapon charms available, allowing you to further customize the visual appearance of your weapons.

This is nearly a full extra week, and more importantly an extra weekend, of golden piggy bucks and the cash blaster. This should also give you the extra time needed to reach that last stretch goal of 20 million piggy bucks to unlock the 9th Anniversary Mega Mask.
