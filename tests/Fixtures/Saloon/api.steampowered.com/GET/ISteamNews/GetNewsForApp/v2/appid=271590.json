However, if you look past the unfinished environments and the unpolished graphics (after all, this is still a game in active development) it looks like GTA 6 is going to play much more like the slower open-world western than it does the Los Santos-based sandbox shooter we know and love, and that's because of a thing called RAGE.<\/p>\\n<p>RAGE is the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine - something that Rockstar Games has been updating and adapting for well over a decade now, and the game engine that both GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 are built on.<\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.theloadout.com\/gta-6\/leaks-gameplay-similar-rdr2\\\">Read the rest of the story...<\/a><\/p>\\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br \/>\\n<a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.theloadout.com\/call-of-duty-warzone-2\/leak-city-poi-gta\\\">Warzone 2 leak claims new map's city POI will feel like GTA<\/a><br \/>\\n<a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.theloadout.com\/nba-2k23\/file-size-xbox-warzone-gta-v\\\">Warzone and GTA V look tiny compared to huge NBA 2K23 file size<\/a><br \/>\\n<a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.theloadout.com\/grand-theft-auto-5\/gta-online-update-criminal enterprises-casino-running\\\">GTA Online update lets you gamble and party faster<\/a><\/p>\",\"feedlabel\":\"The Loadout\",\"date\":1663699505,\"feedname\":\"The Loadout\",\"feed_type\":0,\"appid\":271590},{\"gid\":\"6258337460559291878\",\"title\":\"The impact of the giant GTA 6 leak: PC Gamer reacts\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/steamstore-a.akamaihd.net\/news\/externalpost\/PC Gamer\/6258337460559291878\",\"is_external_url\":true,\"author\":\"Tim Clark\",\"contents\":\"<img src=\\\"https:\/\/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net\/5chVjZ4xfhQcmWsZKkf9Rm.png\\\"\/><br><br>\\n                In the two decades plus I&apos;ve covered gaming, I&apos;m not sure I can recall a leak more startling than this weekend&apos;s <a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/heres-another-alleged-gta-6-leak-this-time-with-video\/\\\">dump of 90 videos<\/a> from a test build of <a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/gta-6-all-the-rumours-in-one-place\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">GTA 6<\/a>.
